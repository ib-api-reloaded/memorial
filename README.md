Notes from [archived thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1b89p89/does_anyone_know_why_the_ib_insync_python_library/?sort=new):

> Dear Ruben de Wit and Family,
> The news of Ewald's passing profoundly saddens us, and we are all the more grateful for his incredible legacy through the ib_insync library. It's genuinely heartwarming to learn of his profound impact on so many people, many of whom, like myself, benefitted immensely from his dedication and brilliance without having had the chance to express our gratitude directly. Ewald's creation has not just been a tool but a community and source of inspiration for all its users. 

> He was so generous with his time and support. His work has been extremely impactful to this community.

> The work he has put into this project, has helped so many people across the world.

> He will be missed by the community.
